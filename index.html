      <h1>Features ‚öôÔ∏è</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Admin Dashboard:</b> A fully customisable multi-theme(dark/light),
          multi-lingual admin dashboard where you can add and delete products,
          manage orders, reviews and even ban or delete users.
          <br />
          You can also modify static content and images of your website on
          different pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Access Control:</b> Very granular control over the admin dashboard
          of your digitalstore, <i>meaning</i> only <b>YOU, THE ADMIN</b> can
          edit the website not your users.
          <br />
          However any customer can manage their
          <i>own orders, reviews and user profile</i> from his own dashboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Advanced Security Practices:</b> Implemented all best grade
          security measures like CSRF, CORS, Rate Limiting, Max Login Attempts
          to prevent DDOS and other cyber attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Great UI/UX & SEO optimized:</b> Developed Clean and smooth UI and
          functionalities like Reset Password, Email Magic Link, Anonymous Carts
          and Feedback Forms for a great User Experience.
          <br />
          As an Admin you can add a product meta description and image for a
          better SEO ranking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Upcoming Features:</b> Seller Accounts so anyone can make money by
          just setting their emails and stripe accounts,The admin can also
          update and manage categories, Navbar and Footer links.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>For Developers:</b> If you as a developer want to extend and
          customise this code, it is very easy to setup. <br />
          I've included both the dev and production docker files with the repo,
          just setup your .env file and voila, you can self-host it wherever you
          want as a standalone node server.

      <h1>The Why ü§∑</h1>
      <p>
        I initially used the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/templates/ecommerce/README.md"
          >ecommerce starter template</a
        >
        of the payload cms to deliver an ecommerce project for a freelance
        client of mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then i came across an awesome video on the
        <a href="https://youtube.com/@joshtriedcoding?si=ISowqgfzOVQ007Mr"
          ><em>Josh Tried Coding</em></a
        >
        Youtube Channel and thought I'll recreate this with some extended but
        necessary features, Also I'm not much of a designer so basically just
        <code>Ctrl + C</code>,<code>Ctrl + V</code> his UI.
        <s><i>(Sorry, not Sorry)</i></s>

      <h1>Challenges üí™</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Really Struggled to get my head around this new paradigm of Server and
          Client Components, changes in next config file and slow development
          times, thought about going with remix as I've had some Experience with
          it, but in the end chose Next
          <small><i>(tradeoffs can be discussed in a blog post)</i></small>
        </li>
        <li>
          First time hosting my next server as part of my express app standalone
          server, most of the features work but still not getting the
          <b><q>Vercel Vibe</q></b
          >, maybe need to configure a CDN for my static assets to make stuff
          faster
        </li>
        <li>
          Setting up payload in an existing and relatively new Next App Router
          was a <del>LOT</del> little bit of work.
        </li>

      <h1>Takeaways üôè</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I am pretty Impressed by NextJS new App Router,
          <i>Server Components and Server Actions</i> are fun to work with once
          you get over the initial dread of <strong><q>use client</q></strong>
          <strong><q>use server</q></strong> derivatives
        </li>
        <li>
          <q><a href="https://trpc.io/docs/quickstart">TRPC</a> for the win</q>,
          sharing types and validations all the way from frontend to backend is
          just üëå
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm never starting a new Project without Zod,React hook form and
          Tanstack Query
